OpenACC

1) Made a new lub_parallel_ACC.cpp with the OpenACC implementation
2) Made a new Makerfile and add all the openACC tags
3) Changed main.cpp to make sure openMP and openACC results go to their respective csv files
3) Open a terminal in local computer and ssh'd into the maxwell gpu node
4) Ran make -f Makerfile_acc clean to compile 
5) Ran ./lud_acc -c -p 

Notes:

1) After testing the OpenACC version if make doesn't work for the openMP version run these
   two commands to handle linking issues

   a) make clean
   b) rm -f *.o lud lud_acc
